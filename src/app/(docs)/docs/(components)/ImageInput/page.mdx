## Features

- **Instant Preview**: Shows selected image immediately with customizable preview size
- **Remove Functionality**: Clean removal with X button that properly updates parent state
- **File Validation**: Built-in image file type validation
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and container widths
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- **Form Integration**: Works seamlessly with form libraries and controlled components
- **External URLs**: Support for displaying images from external URLs
- **Dark Mode Ready**: Consistent styling across light and dark themes

## Fake Event Explanation

When an image is removed using the X button, the component creates a "fake event" to notify the parent component:

```typescript
const fakeEvent = {
  target: { files: null, value: "" },
} as React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>;
onChange?.(fakeEvent);
```

**Why is this needed?**

1. **Parent State Sync**: The parent component often expects an `onChange` event to update its state
2. **Form Library Compatibility**: Form libraries like React Hook Form, Formik expect standard input change events
3. **Controlled Components**: Maintains consistency with how controlled input components work
4. **State Reset**: Ensures both the file input's internal value and parent state are properly cleared

This pattern ensures that removing an image behaves exactly like clearing a regular input field, maintaining consistency across your application's form handling.

Perfect for profile pictures, document uploads, product images, and any scenario requiring image selection with preview.
