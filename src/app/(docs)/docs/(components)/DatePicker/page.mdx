## Advanced Features

### Smart Positioning System

The DatePicker uses an intelligent positioning algorithm that prevents the calendar from being cut off by viewport boundaries. It automatically switches between top and bottom placement based on available space and handles scroll events to maintain proper positioning.

### Holiday and Event Management

Define holidays and special events with custom styling and tooltips. The component supports business logic like disabling weekends and holidays while providing visual indicators for important dates.

### Time Integration

When time selection is enabled, the component seamlessly integrates hour/minute inputs with proper validation and 12-hour format conversion. Time changes are immediately reflected in the selected date value.

### Accessibility Standards

The DatePicker implements comprehensive keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and proper ARIA labeling. All interactive elements are focusable and provide appropriate feedback for assistive technologies.

## Technical Implementation

Built with React 18+ and TypeScript for type safety. Utilizes Framer Motion for smooth animations and portal rendering for reliable positioning. The component follows modern React patterns with proper state management and event handling.

Perfect for applications requiring sophisticated date selection with business rules, scheduling interfaces, or any scenario where standard HTML date inputs are insufficient.
