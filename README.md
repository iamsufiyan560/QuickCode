# [QuickCode](https://quickcode.space)

A modern, high-quality library of copy-pasteable React components and UI blocks designed for developers who prioritize premium design and simplicity. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Nextra for documentation, Framer Motion for animations, and Recharts for charts.

## Features

- **Premium Components**: Professionally designed, ready-to-use React components and UI blocks
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: No complex setup—just copy, paste, and ship
- **Smooth Animations**: Powered by Framer Motion for fluid, engaging transitions
- **Type-Safe**: Built with TypeScript for robust, error-free development
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive components that look great on any device
- **Dark Mode Support**: Seamless integration with Tailwind CSS for light and dark themes
- **Interactive Charts**: Data visualization made easy with Recharts
- **Comprehensive Docs**: Beautiful documentation powered by Nextra

## Installation

[QuickCode](https://quickcode.space) works similarly to shadcn/ui—components are not installed as a package. Instead, you add individual components to your project using our CLI or by manually copying from the documentation.

Install the [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/quickcode-ui) via npm:

```bash
npx quickcode-ui init
```

To add a specific component (e.g., Accordion), use:

```bash
npx quickcode add accordion
```

Or manually copy the component from our [documentation](https://quickcode.space) and paste it into your `components/custom` directory.

Then import and use the component:

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@/components/custom/accordion";
```

## Usage

Import and use [QuickCode](https://quickcode.space) components in your project. Example with the Accordion component:

```tsx
import { Accordion } from "@/components/custom/accordion";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Accordion
      items={[
        { title: "Section 1", content: "This is the content for section 1." },
        { title: "Section 2", content: "This is the content for section 2." },
      ]}
      variant="filled"
      size="lg"
    />
  );
}
```

## Available Components

- **Accordion**: A flexible, animated accordion for collapsible content sections
- **Navbar**: A sticky, modern navigation bar with smooth animations
- **Hero**: Eye-catching hero sections designed for high conversion
- **Card**: Premium cards with hover effects and customizable layouts
- **Button**: Customizable buttons with variants (outline, secondary, ghost, destructive, link) and sizes
- More components and UI blocks available in the `components/custom` directory

Check the documentation (powered by Nextra) for detailed usage and props for each component.
